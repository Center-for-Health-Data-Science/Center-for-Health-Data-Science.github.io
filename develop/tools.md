In HeaDS, we understand the importance of documentation when it comes to sharing and disseminating scientific tools. We believe that providing clear and detailed documentation is crucial for ensuring that our tools are accessible and usable by other researchers. Our documentation includes everything from installation instructions to user guides and code examples. By making our documentation as comprehensive as possible, we hope to empower other researchers to use our tools in their own work and contribute to the broader scientific community's efforts to advance knowledge and discovery.
