HeaDS believes in the principles of open science and reproducibility. As part of our commitment to these values, we strive to make our publications as reproducible as possible. To achieve this, we make our research process transparent by showcasing the GitHub repositories that contain our code and data. We also document our research process to ensure that others can replicate our findings and build upon them. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the wider scientific community's efforts to promote openness and transparency in research.
